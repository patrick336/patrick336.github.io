	The passion for programming started during my early study years and since that time I systematically go further into front-end technology. The secrets of mentioned subjects were discovered by myself.

	The turning point during my education was finishing an intensive <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> course  guided by <strong>KODILLA Team</strong>. This training gave me a solid basis. I understood that I want to pursue in this area in my future job.

	Currently my professional goal is to become a <strong>Javascript Developer</strong>, to which I aspire through learning technologies like <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong> and <strong>React</strong>.
